# manual categorization of pictures

click on pictures in grid to move them from folder *move_from* to folder *move_to*.  
makes manual selections of pictures easier.

tested in Python version 3.7.7 on Windows 10

**important:**  
- if elements exist in folder *move_to*, files with identical names to be moved will be removed
- files are not moved until pygame window is closed

**TODO:**  
- think of way to save progress in case of crash
- allow video categorization
- specify package requirements
